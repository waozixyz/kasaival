# Welcome

Kasaival is an arcade style adventure game.

Kasai is an out of control flame and this flame is you.
You want to survive, but you can only do so by burning and nurishing yourself through plant matter.


In this adventurous world you are constantly in the fight to perserve your out of control existence.

Strange water creatures spawn and the climate is going more and more crazy over time.
How long can you survive?
